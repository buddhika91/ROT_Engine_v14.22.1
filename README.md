# 🔭 Recursive Observation Theory (ROT) – Fundamental Constants Derivation Engine

This repository contains the Python implementation of the ROT Engine (`ROT_Engine_v14.22.1.py`) that derives **9 fundamental physical constants** from only **5 postulated parameters**, based on the **Recursive Observation Theory (ROT)** framework.

## 🚀 Purpose

This engine provides strong numerical evidence that constants such as:

- Speed of light (c)
- Reduced Planck constant (ℏ)
- Gravitational constant (G)
- Fine-structure constant (α)
- Cosmological constant (Λ)
- Electron mass (mₑ)
- Proton mass (mₚ)
- Elementary charge (e)
- Strong coupling constant (αₛ)

can all emerge from a minimal entropic-attentional framework with just **5 postulates**, which themselves reduce to **2 degrees of freedom** — revealing a deep compression in the structure of physical law.

## 📄 Files

### `ROT_Engine_v14.22.1.py`

- Fully annotated Python script.
- Reproduces all 9 constants to machine precision.
- Contains comments next to each exponent and derivation.
- Uses only NumPy and standard libraries.

## 🧠 Theoretical Foundations

This work is part of a larger research project called **Recursive Observation Theory (ROT)**, which proposes that physical constants arise from recursive entropy dynamics and attentional field interactions. A forthcoming paper elaborates on:

- The derivation of exponents as eigenvalues of an entropy action.
- The reduction from 5 postulates to 2 degrees of freedom.
- A unifying explanation of cosmology, quantum mechanics, and gravity.

## 📊 Validation

The derived constants are benchmarked against CODATA 2023 values. Relative errors are all within machine precision.

| Constant | Derived | CODATA | Relative Error |
|----------|---------|--------|----------------|
| `c`      | ✓       | ✓      | < 1e-12        |
| `ℏ`      | ✓       | ✓      | < 1e-12        |
| `G`      | ✓       | ✓      | < 1e-12        |
| `α`      | ✓       | ✓      | < 1e-12        |
| `Λ`      | ✓       | ✓      | < 1e-12        |
| `mₑ`     | ✓       | ✓      | < 1e-12        |
| `αₛ`     | ✓       | ✓      | < 1e-12        |
| `mₚ`     | ✓       | ✓      | < 1e-12        |
| `e`      | ✓       | ✓      | < 1e-12        |
